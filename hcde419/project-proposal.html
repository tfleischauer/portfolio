        <div class="project_details_p">
          <p>Our Human Centered Design and Engineering team decided to address the space of remote music collaboration.</p> 
                  
          <p>Preparing for this presentation required the team to decide on a project concept, and the research methods needed to design the system.</p>
          
          <p>Each group member individually prepared and presented a sequence of slides outlining our proposal.</p> 
          
          <p>The Project Proposal was a pechakucha presentation (20 slides at a rate of 20 seconds per slide.)</p> 
          
          <p>I presented slides 6 through 10 that spoke about how musicians currently collaborate.</p>
