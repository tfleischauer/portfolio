        <div class="project_details_p">
        <p>With no constraints on the visual design, my team elected to individually design and present an aspect of the prototype that we felt was important.</p> 
        
        <p>I contributed a feature to allow remote collaborators to upload black and white documents that could be shown to both parties on a digital whiteboard (slides 4 - 7.)</p>
        
        <p>The content of an uploaded document would be erasable, like a chalkboard eraser. Collaborators could use a mouse, stylus, or type directly into the whiteboard area to express their ideas.</p> 
        
        <p>This document-to-digital-whiteboard feature was based off research on how some collaborators write notes and pseudo charts in-person.</p>
        
        <p>Simultaneously, the environment would allow video conferencing for better communication such as facial expressions and tone of voice. Textual chat would also be an option for users who desired a more private or asynchronous approach.</p>
