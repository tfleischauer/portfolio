        <p class="long-text">With no constraints on the visual design, my team elected to individually design and present an aspect of the prototype that we felt was important.</p> 
        
        <p class="long-text">I contributed a feature to allow remote collaborators to upload documents that could be visible to both parties on a digital whiteboard (slides 4 - 7.)</p>
        
        <p class="long-text">The content of an uploaded document in the viewing area is erasable, like using a chalkboard eraser. Collaborators could use a mouse, stylus, or type directly into the whiteboard area to express their ideas.</p> 
        
        <p class="long-text">This document-to-digital-whiteboard feature was based on our research that showed some collaborators prefer to write notes and pseudo charts in-person.</p>
        
        <p class="long-text">Simultaneously, the environment would allow video conferencing for better communication such as facial expressions and tone of voice.</p> 
        
        <p class="long-text">Textual chat would also be an option for users who desired a more private or asynchronous approach.</p>
        
        <p class="long-text">This image shows a scenario where personas Mark the Musician and Paul the Producer use the digital whiteboard to work out a chord sequence for their song.</p>
