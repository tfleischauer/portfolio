        <p>Our team performed:</p> 
        	<ul>
                <li>Competitive Research</li> 
                <li>Literature Reviews</li>
                <li>User Interviews</li> 
            </ul> 
        
        <p>I performed the Competitive Research, and the whole team performed Literature Reviews.</p> 
        
        <p>For the Competitive Research, I created accounts at existing music collaboration sites. I used the systems, and compared features.</p> 
        
        <p>One recurring discovery was that many collaborative sites were closer to social media sites than real-time collaboration environments. We were seeking to design a real-time collaboration environment.</p>
