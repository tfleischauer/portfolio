        <p>Our Final Report:</p>
        <ul>
        	<li>Summarized our research methods and findings</li>
            <li>Showed our design process (such as creating personas and scenarios, use of instructor and class feedback, iteration, and testing.)</li>
            <li>Outlined and Documented our User Interface concepts</li>
        </ul>	
        
        <p>Our final project also included a video prototype. The prototype showed the interaction between our personas Mark the Musician in Concrete WA, and Paul the Producer in New York.</p> 
        
        <p>Mark the Musician and Paul the Producer use the digital whiteboard to work out differing conceptual details of how a chord sequence of their song should go.</p>
        
        <p>We also used a third persona, Lucy the Listener, who used the system as a means of commentary on Mark and Paul’s evolving song. The graphical interface showed the audio files as a time line. Lucy was able to make comments on specific areas of their uploaded sound files.</p> 
        
        <p>Although, Lucy the Listener’s role was different than a producer or musician, she was ultimately a collaborator in the process. Lucy provided perspective from an actual ‘user’ of the music, a potential fan.</p>
