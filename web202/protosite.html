        <p>A quick and dirty HTML Protosite sequence.</p> 
        
        <p>This was one of the first projects I made at Seattle Central. I made this protosite before completing Web Authoring II, Web Authoring III, and Theory of Web Design. Needless to say, this protosite is pretty much ad-hoc.</p>
        
        <p>I definitely would mark this up differently now. For example, the elements could be grouped and floated differently. I would also use {less} for the CSS.</p>
        
        <p>This protosite was made with the text editor in Dreamweaver.</p>
