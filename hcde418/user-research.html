        <p>Our team’s research methods were:</p> 
        	<!--<ul>
            	<li>Contextual Inquiry</li> 
                <li>Electronic Survey</li> 
                <li>Diary Study</li>
                <li>Related Work Review</li> 
 			</ul>-->
          
        <h2>Contextual Inquiry</h2>         
        <p>The Contextual Inquiry included observation of the behaviors of three participants in their college dorm as they communicated with their family and friends remotely.</p>
        
        <h2>Electronic Survey</h2>  
        <p>27 students completed the electronic survey. The survey asked a series of questions about student preferences and mediums of communication.</p> 
        
        <p>I contributed by writing survey questions and analyzing the returned data.</p>
        
        <h2>Diary Study</h2> 
        <p>The diary study consisted of seven participants who logged their communications over a five-day period.</p>
        
        <p>I contributed by acting as a facilitator of the study and participant recruiter. I analyzed data of all the participants to look for similarities and trends.</p>
        
        <h2>Related Work Review</h2> 
        <p>Each team member read related academic work for discussion and comparison of findings at team meetings.</p>
