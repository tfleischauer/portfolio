          <p>After our User Research and Persona creation, the team held meetings to show and discuss sketches and drawings.</p> 
          
          <p>Often the team meetings would include white boarding to aid us in our ideation and exploration of ways to solve the problem of bringing a sense of home to students living remotely.</p> 
          
          <p>The team would explore and discuss strengths, weaknesses, feasibility, originality, and whether the proposed solutions would fit the needs of our personas.</p>
