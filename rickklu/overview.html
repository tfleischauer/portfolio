        	<h2>Overview</h2>
            
            <p>I am honored to have the opportunity to work with Rick Klu Art on an online storefront and portfolio website.</p>

            <!--<p>Since 1990, Rick Klu has designed murals, posters, paintings, t-shirts, album covers, and more around Seattle, Tuscan, and Los Angeles. However, Rick might be best known as “the coaster guy” for his artistic drawings on bar coasters.</p>--> 

			<!--<p>Rick trusted me enough to allow me to help him visually define the breadth and chronology of his work as represented in the Portfolio section. We came a long way from the temptation to label many items “miscellaneous” and “random”.</p>-->
           
	    	<p>This site is on schedule to go live in early 2019.</p> 
                
            <p>Skills and Technologies: WordPress development (HTML5, CSS3, PHP, jQuery); Responsive Design; Information Architecture; Adobe Photoshop; and Adobe Dreamweaver.</p>
