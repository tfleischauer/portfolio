        	<h2>Overview</h2>   
            
            <p>This project was for an introductory WordPress course at Seattle Central College in summer 2014.</p> 
            
            <p>The class had the option of doing a personal site, or working with a client. I chose to work with Giddy Throng to gain more client-facing experience.</p> 
            
            <p>Giddy Throng is a business that buys collectible and vintage items, often refurbishes the items, then acts as a reseller.</p>
            
            <p>The clients did not have an existing site and wanted a system to aggregate and present their products.</p>
            
            <p>Skills used : Illustrator, Photoshop, HTML, CSS, Responsive Design, WordPress</p>
