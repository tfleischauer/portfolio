        	<h2>Overview</h2>   
            
            <p>This project was for an accelerated introductory WordPress course at Seattle Central College in summer 2014. Students were required to learn WordPress, in-part, by building a custom WordPress theme in eight weeks.</p>
            
            <p>The class had the option of doing a personal site, or working with a client. I chose to work with Giddy Throng to gain more client-facing experience.</p> 
            
            <!--<p>Giddy Throng is a business that buys collectible and vintage items, often refurbishes the items, then acts as a reseller.</p>-->
            
            <!--<p>The clients did not have an existing site and wanted a system to aggregate and present their products.</p>-->
            
            <p>Skills used: Illustrator, Photoshop, Dreamweaver, HTML, CSS, Responsive Design, WordPress.</p>
