        <!--<p>After completing our second assignment, a ‘sand box’ installation of WordPress for the class exercises in week two of the eight-week course, we then needed to create Static Templates for the Course Project due in week three.</p>-->
         
		<p>Creating the Static Templates guided me to make general layout decisions, and gave me some experience using BXSlider (a jQuery plugin) for the hero image slideshow.</p> 
        
        <p>As I learned more about WordPress plug-ins, BXSlider was later replaced by a non-hardcoded client-friendly (Dashboard accessible) WordPress plug-in called Huge IT Slider.</p>
        
        <!--<p>Huge IT Slider allows the client to easily change the hero images and text in the WordPress dashboard.</p>-->
        
        <h2>Writing for the Web</h2>
        <p>While taking this WordPress course, I also took a course called 'Writing for the Web.'</p>
        
        <p>Eventually, I prioritized including a section with SEO rich keywords in the form of a text description about the company.</p>
