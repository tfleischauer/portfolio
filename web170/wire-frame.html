          <!--<p>Summer quarter is only eight weeks long. This was an abbreviated and accelerated introductory WordPress course compared to a normal twelve-week quarter.</p>-->
          
          <p>This eight-week course allowed about a week to find a client, and to solidify the project concept.</p> 
          
          <p>Discovery exercises and wire frames were not a course requirement, but have become part of my usual work flow.</p>
          
          <p>I made this quick wire frame in Adobe Illustrator to get the conversation started.</p> 
          
          <p>I also conducted abbreviated exercises with my client to identify who would be their anticipated users, and what their potential needs might be.</p> 
          
          <p>My worst fear is spending time creating a system that no one will use.</p>
