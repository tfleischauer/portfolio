          <p>This was an abbreviated and accelerated introductory WordPress course.</p>
          
          <p>The course allowed about a week to find a client, and for discovery of the client’s goals and needs of the system’s users.</p> 
  
          <p>Wire frames were not a requirement but have become part of my usual work flow.</p> 
          
          <p>I chose to make this quick wire frame in Adobe Illustrator, to get the conversation started with my client.</p> 		
  
          <p>I did additional unassigned discovery exercises where I had my client identify who his anticipated users are and to anticipate their needs (an abbreviated version of the discovery methodology used for the Nan Nalder piece.)</p>
          
          <p>My worst fear is spending time creating a system that no one will use.</p>
