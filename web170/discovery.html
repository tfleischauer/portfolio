          <p>This course was definitely more about learning WordPress, and how to build custom themes in WordPress, than User-Experience Design.</p>
                  
          <p>Discovery exercises, wire frames, and design comps were not a course requirement; but have become part of my usual work flow.</p>
          
          <p>I conducted abbreviated exercises with my clients to identify <i>who</i> would be their anticipated users, and <i>what</i> these anticipated users might need.</p> 
          
          <p>I also made this quick wire frame, as well as these quick and dirty design comps, in Illustrator to solicit feedback from my client before starting any markup.</p>
