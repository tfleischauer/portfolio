        <p>This course was more about learning WordPress than User-Experience Design.</p> 
        
        <!--<p>The following were not required for the course, and were practically out of scope:</p>
        
        <ul>
        	<li>Client Meetings &amp; Approval</li>
            <li>Discovery Period</li>
            <li>Wire Frames</li>
            <li>Design Comps</li>
            <li>Responsive Design</li>
        </ul>-->
        
        <p>Design Comps were not required, but are part of my current design process.</p> 
        
        <p>In Adobe Illustrator, I made these quick and dirty design comps in the first week of the quarter to solicit feedback before starting any markup.</p>
        
        <!--<p>Yet, I didnâ€™t want to build the wrong system. I conducted the discovery exercises,--><!-- and created the resulting assets,--> <!--including these quick and dirty design comps, in the first week of the quarter.</p>-->

		<!--<p>Unfortunately, the first week of the quarter was also the Fourth of July weekend and my clients were vacationing.</p> -->
        
        <!--<p>Within a 12-hour period of my initial client meeting, before the holiday weekend, I produced these quick design comps to show my clients for feedback.</p> -->
