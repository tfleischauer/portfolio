        <p>Design Comps were not required for this course, but are part of my current design process.</p> 
        
        <!--<p>This course was more about learning WordPress than User-Experience Design.</p> -->
        
        <p>In Adobe Illustrator, I made these quick and dirty design comps <!--in a few hours during the first week of the quarter-->to solicit feedback from my client before starting any markup.</p>
        
        <!--<p>Yet, I didnâ€™t want to build the wrong system. I conducted the discovery exercises,--><!-- and created the resulting assets,--> <!--including these quick and dirty design comps, in the first week of the quarter.</p>-->

		<!--<p>Unfortunately, the first week of the quarter was also the Fourth of July weekend and my clients were vacationing.</p> -->
        
        <!--<p>Within a 12-hour period of my initial client meeting, before the holiday weekend, I produced these quick design comps to show my clients for feedback.</p> -->
