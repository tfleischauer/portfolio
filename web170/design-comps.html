        <p>This was an abbreviated and accelerated introductory WordPress course.</p>
        
        <p>Client meetings, discovery period, wire frames, and design comps were not required and were practically out of scope.</p>
        
        <p>Yet, I didnâ€™t want to build the wrong system, so all of these exercises and assets were made or took place in the first week of the quarter.</p>

		<p>Unfortunately, the first week of the quarter was also the Fourth of July weekend and my clients were vacationing.</p> 
        
        <p>Within a 12-hour period of my initial client meeting, before the holiday weekend, I produced these quick design comps to show my clients for feedback.</p>
