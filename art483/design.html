        	<p class="long-text">Our team wanted to design a system to keep seniors engaged in their interpersonal relationships both during and after their conversations.</p>
        	
        	<p class="long-text"><!--Our team identified 'Dignity' as a key design component.--> Our interviews with senior citizens showed that having to ask "What?" can result in a loss of desire to participate in conversations, and potentially a loss of dignity.</p>
            
            <p class="long-text"> To this end, MARK* is a non-intrusive means of bridging conversations.</p> 
          
          <p class="long-text">Our final design was a migrating application that acts as an audio filter that leverages hyperlinking with a system of tagging (or marking) parts of conversations that are too important to interrupt.</p>
          
          <p class="long-text">Marked conversation pieces can be referenced immediately or reviewed later. The system allows the user to find out what the conversation is about, or was about, without having to ask "What?"</p>
