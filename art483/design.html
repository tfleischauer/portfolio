          <p>Our team identified 'Dignity' as a key design component.</p> 
          
          <p>Our interviews with senior citizens showed that having to ask "What?" can result in a loss of desire to participate in conversations, and potentially a loss of dignity.</p>
            
          <p> To this end, MARK* is a non-intrusive means of bridging conversations.</p> 
          
          <p>Our final design was a migrating application that acts as an audio filter that leverages hyperlinking with a system of tagging (or marking) parts of conversations that are too important to interrupt.</p>
          
          <p>Marked conversation pieces can be referenced immediately or reviewed later.</p> 
          
          <p>The system allows the user to find out what the conversation is about, or was about, without having to ask "What?"</p>
