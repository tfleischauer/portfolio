        <h2>Overview</h2>
        
        <p>Even though the official name was ART 483: Advanced Interaction Design, this UW course was more commonly known as 'Microsoft Expo.'<p>
        
        <p>'Microsoft Expo' is a design competition for invited Interaction Design programs to showcase their ideas adhering to a theme.</p> 
        
        <p>This competition's theme was 'Information in my World.'</p>
        
        <h2>Our Team</h2>
        <p>Our IxD team focused attention to the aging population.</p> 
          
        <p>We wanted to design a system to keep seniors engaged in their interpersonal relationships both during and after their conversations.</p>
