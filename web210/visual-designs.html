        <p>We made several versions of the Visual Designs in Illustrator.</p> 
        
        <p>The Visual Design deliverable doubled as a way to express varying design ideas, and also to be a study of free typefaces from Google fonts.</p>
        
        <p>I headed up the typography. I wanted the comps to show the typefaces as they would appear on the site.</p>
        
        <p>I did some research on the most popular Google Fonts and used those to guide my experimentation.</p>
        
        <p>After showing the clients the visual designs, they indicated that they prefered specific elements in varying designs.</p> 
        
        <p>Our design solution was to aggregate some of the client's preferences from our various visual designs into our page templates.</p>
