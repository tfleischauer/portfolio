        <p>After drawing up some contracts for the clients, the design team was responsible for determining the Information Architecture.</p>
        
        <p>Based off notes from our client meeting, we started with a card sort.</p> 
        
        <p>We decided to try Google Drawings instead of using Illustrator or Photoshop to make an Information Architecture diagram.</p> 
        
        <p>Google Drawings allowed for the whole team to participate in diagramming or commenting, plus version control.</p>
        
        <p>Eventually the team arrived at a solution. After a few adjustments, our instructor approved the diagram.</p>
        
        <p>We then discussed the proposed Information Architecture with the clients for their approval.</p>
