        <p>After drawing up <a href="https://earthshipseattle210.wordpress.com/a3-project-proposal/" target="_blank">Project Proposal</a> and <a href="https://earthshipseattle210.wordpress.com/a3-terms-conditions/" target="_blank">Terms &amp; Conditions</a> contracts, the design team was responsible for determining the Information Architecture.</p>
        
        <p>Based off notes from our initial client meeting, we started with a card sort.</p> 
        
        <p>We decided to try Google Drawings instead of using Illustrator or Photoshop to make an Information Architecture diagram.</p> 
        
        <p>Google Drawings allowed for the whole team to participate in diagramming, commenting, and also offered version control.</p>
        
        <p>Eventually the team arrived at a solution, and after a few adjustments, our instructor approved the diagram.</p>
        
        <p>We then discussed the proposed Information Architecture with the clients for their approval.</p>
