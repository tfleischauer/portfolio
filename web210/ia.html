        <h2>Initial Client Meeting</h2>
            <p>In our initial meeting, Earthship Seattle expressed that they wanted to replace their <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/earthshipseattle2/" target="_blank">existing site</a>  and gave us insight to some of their goals, and how they intended for users to use the site.</p>
        
        <p><span class="strong">After drawing up <a href="https://earthshipseattle210.wordpress.com/a3-project-proposal/" target="_blank">Project Proposal</a> and <a href="https://earthshipseattle210.wordpress.com/a3-terms-conditions/" target="_blank">Terms &amp; Conditions</a> contracts</span>, the design team was responsible for determining the Information Architecture.</p>
        
        <p>Based off notes from our initial client meeting, we started with a card sort.</p> 
        
        <p>We decided to try Google Drawings instead of using Illustrator or Photoshop to make an Information Architecture diagram. Google Drawings allowed for the whole team to participate in diagramming, commenting, and also offered version control.</p>
        
        <p>Eventually the team arrived at a solution, and after a few adjustments, our instructor approved the diagram. We then discussed the proposed Information Architecture with the clients for their approval.</p>
