        <p>The workflow that students were generally taught in web design courses at Seattle Central in 2013 and 2014 was to convert Illustrator designs into static HTML ‘Page Templates’ before breaking those files down into WordPress php files.</p>
         
		<p>For this course, one of our instructors proposed that we take a different approach.</p> 
        
        <p>Instead of making static templates, the team installed WordPress on an Amazon Virtual Private Server.</p> 
        
        <p>Next, the team made a repository on GitHub. The designers worked locally with MAMP, then pushed their Wordpress CSS and php files to GitHub. The developers would pull GitHub files from the Amazon Virtual Private Server.</p> 
        
        <p>This approach turned out to be an excellent exercise in collaboration with version control, and has changed my concept of workflow.</p>
