          <p>In Illustrator, our team decided to make wire frames on a grid that matched our primary media queries: 480px, 800px, and 940px.</p>
          
          <p>We eventually added two more break points: 640 the mid-way point between 480 and 800, and 320px to account for our designâ€™s minimum width / lowest resolution devices.</p>
          
          <p>We also gained more experience with organizing our layer panels so that we could collaboratively exchange Illustrator files as we developed our concepts.</p>
