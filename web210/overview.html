        	<h2>Overview</h2>   
            
            <p>Earthship Seattle was a group design and development Website project at Seattle Central College in Autumn 2014.</p> 
            
            <p>Two designers enrolled in WEB 210: Advanced Web Design were paired with two developers enrolled in ITC 210: Advanced Web Development.</p>
            
            <p>Although I was enrolled in WEB 210, I participated in both roles, as designer and developer.</p>
            
            <h2>Initial Client Meeting</h2>
            <p>In our initial meeting, the clients expressed that they wanted to replace their <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/earthshipseattle2/" target="_blank">existing site</a>. 
            
            <p>The clients also gave us some insight to some of their goals, and how they intended for users to use the site.</p>
