        	<h3>Overview</h3>  
            
            <p>This was a team project at Seattle Central College. Two students from Advanced Web Design were paired with two students from Advanced Web Development.</p>
            
            <p>Each team was assigned to design and build a custom WordPress site for a client from a non-profit organization.</p>
            
            <p>I was enrolled as a designer, but also participated in development of the site.</p> 
           
            <p>After the quarter ended, I continued work on the project and completed the site for internship credit in spring 2015.</p>
        
            
            <p>Skills used: Illustrator, Photoshop, HTML, CSS, PHP, Responsive Design, WordPress, Komodo Edit, GitHub.</p>
