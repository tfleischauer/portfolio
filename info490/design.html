        <p>Our project was a design interface and system that leveraged results from a RIASEC personality assessment to the UWâ€™s Academic Learning Links.</p> 
        
        <p>Academic Learning Links are a categorization system that the UW uses to group each academic major into a 'bucket' of related academic majors.</p> 
        
        <p>Amongst all eight 'bucket' groups falls every academic major at the University of Washington.</p>
        
        <p>Our goal was to create a system that would be simple, intuitive, and engaging for students to begin their major exploration.
