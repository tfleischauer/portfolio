        <p>Normally I would have done much of this layout work by making wire frames, but due to time constraints wire frames were skipped for this project.<!--Normally I would have done much of this work in a wire frame stage, but the structure of this course had us skip wire frames.--></p>
        
        <h3>About the Design - Thumbnails</h3>
        <p>I chose this layout for the Portfolio pages because I wanted large thumbnails.</p> 
        
        <p>Each thumbnail only shows a glimpse, a small section, of each painting.</p>
