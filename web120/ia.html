        <p>A second exploratory exercise was for my client and I to anticipate user questions. These user questions would help us to determine how to design the site's layout.</p> 
        
        <p>We wanted the layout to be user-centric, and as Steve Krug says to never, ever make the user have to think. In other words, we wanted an intuitive layout.</p>
        
        <p>After a couple sessions of posing potential user questions, I was able to associate the questions with a location in the evolving site proposal.</p> 
        
        <p>I made an information architecture diagram that corresponded to potential user questions in Adobe Illustrator.</p>
        
        <p>I showed this diagram to my client, and we made a few adjustments, before she signed off on the architecture.</p>
        
        <p>This exercise also served as the foundation for our site map.</p>
