        <div class="project_details_p">
        <p>After determining the general site architecture, I made several design comps in Adobe Illustrator to express some variations of a theme that I wanted to develop for this project.</p> 
        
        <p>The picture shown here from the first set of comps shows a low level state, an image that has been clicked on.</p>
        
        <h2>Design Concept</h2>
        <p>My overall concept for this site was to be as transparent as possible.</p> 
        
        <p>The paintings are so great, I just wanted to feature them and stay out of the way.</p> 
        
        <p>Hopefully, the user barely even notices the web design.</p>
